This enables control over the flow of control and enables the performance of many actions depending on changing situations. The major conditional statements used in Python include if, elif, and else. This statement makes an evaluation for the stated condition and follows with execution of a code block determined by if the condition comes true. The elif enables the program to further specify that more conditions may be described should the first conditional state turn out to be not true. The else state is the final conditional statement whose block is executed when everything prior in the if / else construct is determined false. In general, conditional statements are used to allow the program to execute various kinds of logic and reasoning based on user input and when the program itself needs to function.\n",

When the condition of the if does not come true, the program shifts over to the elif condition for its truthfulness. In case the elif condition comes true, then the block of codes associated with it gets executed. If the if or elif conditions are not true, the else block will get executed only when defined.\n"

        "      The only fundamental difference between the use of for and while loops in Python lies in their specific application and the level of control they present over the iterations. For loops are used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, or when a collection, such as a list, tuple, or range, needs to be iterated through. The aggregation can be a list of many things, and the code fragment goes through and executes its operations on each of these objects in the list. On the other hand, a while loop is good when the total number of iterations cannot be known ahead of time to permit the execution of the code; in this case, the loop will run while some given condition holds. It is not dependent on any constant variable; rather, it is strictly dependent upon the performance evaluation of the loop, which takes place before the concerned iteration. If the condition is satisfied, the program of the loop continues its execution process. Because of the nature of their control structures, it is often the case that for and while loops give equivalent results; hence, for loops are usually used far more often than while loops when the number of iterations that are needed is known in advance, because a condition will not affect this decision.\n",
